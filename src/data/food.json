I was skeptical at first because I didn't want to overload on pork dishes, but I ended up getting the pork katsu for an appetizer and pork belly tortellini as my starter anyways. I don't even know if that was a mistake, because everything was so good. This place had some of the best pasta I've ever had. A 3 course meal for $42 honestly isn't too bad when you consider the quality of each dish and the generous portions in the appetizer. I had a pork katsu to start, which wasn't anything amazing but was cooked perfectly. The main star of the show was the luau leaf pork belly tortellini in a coconut broth, served with shrimp and clams. For dessert, I shared an upside down pineapple cake served with scoops of vanilla, pineapple, and coconut ice cream."

I wish this location served lamb over rice, but unfortunately they only serve chicken, beef gyro, or a combination of both (they also have falafels, though Mahmoun's Falafel is a better pick for that and is really close by). This is solid Halal Guys food and the decor is nothing special, but let's be honest here, you're here go gorge yourself on cheap street food without actually having to eat on the streets on a cold winter day in Union Square. I will admit, however, that the lettuce and tomatoes they used at this location tasted fresher than what you would usually get elsewhere."

It reminded me of my time as a Middle School student eating taquitos out of the freezer, only as a sophisticated adult. I know that comparison doesn't really do this recipe justice, but that's still one of the highest praises I can give to a recipe, because I absolutely loved eating bags of frozen taquitos right after school."

The menus are huge and varied as is the case with most Chinese restaurants, so it's only natural for dishes to be hit or miss.<br/> <br/>In our case, the potstickers were too thick and the pork filling wasn't as flavorful as you'd hope. The rice cakes were completely bland and could really have used a kick of soy sauce. As for the rest, the food was great and the atmosphere was busy. That's just how it is when you visit Chinatown for lunch on a weekend, I suppose."

This place serves a solid bowl of ramen nonetheless, and you'll be attracted like flies to a bright light on a cold winter's day because the whole restaurant is a bright red that's reminiscent of an alarm light in a submarine. Their main takeaway is the Spicy Stamina Ginger Ramen which comes with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, a boatload of ginger, pork belly, and half an egg. The pork belly was delicious, though I would say that it's kind of hard to mess that up in a ramen! The butter miso is also a solid pick, as the butter gives the miso broth a more hearty flavor to your standard miso ramen fare.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible place by any means.

There's nothing that screams amazing about this recipe, but it's good old greasy comfort food in a way that's kind of like your standard American bacon and eggs with hash browns, but with some <i>exotic</i> twists like fried tomatoes and baked beans. I would have loved to try some blood sausage too, but perhaps that will be for another day.<br/><br/> The New Yorkers in us decided to swap bagels for toast because we couldn't be assed to buy a whole loaf of bread if we were going to use roughly two to three slices. But if you're in New York City, why not use a bagel instead? It's damn near impossible to find a shitty bagel in the city."

The Khmer fish cakes were delicious with just the right amount of crispness and spiciness that you would want to compliment the fishy flavors from the patty. The Kuythiew was essentially the Cambodian version of Pad Thai and featured a lot more beansprouts and a type of rice noodle that was rounder and stringer than your usuall Pad Thai noodles. It was reminiscent of the type of noodle you would eat in a high-end instant noodle pack, but I mean that in the most endearing way. It was eggy, salty, sour, sweet, and everything that you would expect in a high quality Pad Thai. <br/><br/> The shrimp and avocado curry was a bit on the pricey side, but I guess that's the price you pay when those damn millennials are ruining Saturday brunches with their avocadoes. Jokes aside, avocado is surprisingly a great complement to red curry, and I'm glad it came out in chunks as opposed to being mashed into the sauce."

Maybe it's just because we aren't <b>sophisticated</b> enough to cook French cuisine, but these roast vegetables were time consuming and underwhelming. This isn't to say that this recipe is disgusting by any means; infact, tastewise the ratatouille turned out rather good. It's hard to mess up parmesan cheeese with vegetables in an oven. But our first attempt was a soupy mess most likely because our container wasn't wide enough for the vegetables to cook evenly. <br/> <br/> ...which led us to our second attempt, in which we used the cast iron skillet to fry the vegetables slowly so they would cook evenly. But at that point, we stopped using parmesan cheese because we ran out, and the food was rather bland. I guess you really can't improv on French cooking like you would in other styles, because there really wasn't a lot of seasoning or flavor added to this at all. It's just dependent on some rosemary, thyme, and perfectly cooked ingredients to get the job done, and I guess that's something us <i>amateur</i> chefs don't particularly shine with."

Overall, this was an amazing use of chicken wings and leftover parmesan cheese. This was paired with the ratatouille in day 2 of our attempt to create a decent version of the recipe, but this clearly outshined the main dish just like the parmesan couscous."

The Fruit Loop and cereal milk ice cream was exactly this -- an ice cream with the savory taste of cereal mixed with the sweet, artificial taste of Fruit Loops.

Perhaps my expectations of mapo tofu were skewed because of how I'm usually used to eating the dish.<br/><br/> The spicy cumin lamb was a complete hit, however.
