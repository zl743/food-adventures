   "descriptions": "This place was awesome. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want to overload on pork dishes, but I ended up getting the pork katsu for an appetizer and pork belly tortellini as my starter anyways. I don't even know if that was a mistake, because everything was so good. This place had some of the best pasta I've ever had. A 3 course meal for $42 honestly isn't too bad when you consider the quality of each dish and the generous portions in the appetizer. I had a pork katsu to start, which wasn't anything amazing but was cooked perfectly. The main star of the show was the luau leaf pork belly tortellini in a coconut broth, served with shrimp and clams. For dessert, I shared an upside down pineapple cake served with scoops of vanilla, pineapple, and coconut ice cream."

  "descriptions": "This NYC mainstay has gone global. I've been eating at the Halal Guys food cart from 53rd Street for a while amongst other similar meat over rice options on the streets, but I've never been to the Union Square sit-in location. I wish this location served lamb over rice, but unfortunately they only serve chicken, beef gyro, or a combination of both (they also have falafels, though Mahmoun's Falafel is a better pick for that and is really close by). This is solid Halal Guys food and the decor is nothing special, but let's be honest here, you're here go gorge yourself on cheap street food without actually having to eat on the streets on a cold winter day in Union Square. I will admit, however, that the lettuce and tomatoes they used at this location tasted fresher than what you would usually get elsewhere."

 "descriptions": "If you're craving some Mexican food, this is going to be some of the heaviest, cheesiest messes of beans, meat, and tortilla around. This recipe took less than an hour to make from start to finish including baking time, and was relatively easy to make. While enchiladas aren't exactly something you would want to eat on a daily basis (at least I wouldn't), this recipe definitely hit the spot and satisfied my Mexican food cravings. It reminded me of my time as a Middle School student eating taquitos out of the freezer, only as a sophisticated adult. I know that comparison doesn't really do this recipe justice, but that's still one of the highest praises I can give to a recipe, because I absolutely loved eating bags of frozen taquitos right after school."

"descriptions": "Sometimes you need to get a fill of Chinese food, whether it's amazing or not. This was your standard Chinatown fare which is perfectly good and dandy, but nothing truly blew me out of the water. We had drunken chicken, rice cakes, potstickers, soup dumplings, and bamboo shoots with pork. The menus are huge and varied as is the case with most Chinese restaurants, so it's only natural for dishes to be hit or miss.<br/> <br/>In our case, the potstickers were too thick and the pork filling wasn't as flavorful as you'd hope. The rice cakes were completely bland and could really have used a kick of soy sauce. As for the rest, the food was great and the atmosphere was busy. That's just how it is when you visit Chinatown for lunch on a weekend, I suppose."

 "descriptions": "I'm going to be completely honest when I say that the only reason that you would stop here as opposed to any other of the amazing ramen shops around NYC is if you were playing board games next door at The Uncommons (which is a fucking awesome place by the way). This place serves a solid bowl of ramen nonetheless, and you'll be attracted like flies to a bright light on a cold winter's day because the whole restaurant is a bright red that's reminiscent of an alarm light in a submarine. Their main takeaway is the Spicy Stamina Ginger Ramen which comes with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, a boatload of ginger, pork belly, and half an egg. The pork belly was delicious, though I would say that it's kind of hard to mess that up in a ramen! The butter miso is also a solid pick, as the butter gives the miso broth a more hearty flavor to your standard miso ramen fare.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible place by any means. It's just not a place you would go out of your way to visit when there are so many amazing options available (I'm looking at you, Momosan)."

 "descriptions": "Kimchi fried rice is a quick and easy solution to leftovers in the fridge just like any other fried rice recipe. Spam and kimchi is such a good combination of flavors all while being cheap as hell to make. What's even better is when you put cheese on top of the fried rice if you're willing to forego being a traditionalist snob. Don't knock it until you try it, because cheese, spam, and kimchi fried rice is the pinnacle of fusion food done right.<br/><br/>We ate this fried rice with some leftover roasted vegetables (broccoli, mushrooms, onions, zucchini) and some tofu with tomatoes. It can go with pretty much anything, really."

Most bodegas that sell sandwiches will toast their bread really hard or use some baguettes that destroy the upper pallet of your mouth, but this bread was warm, fluffy, yet crisp on the outside without being too rough. The chorizo torta was a great brunch option with that fried egg, but the Picadillo torta was even more amazing with the seasoned ground beef, avocado, caramelized onions, and grilled oaxaca cheese. The pickled vegetables and tortilla chips that came with the meal were perfect compliments to the heaviness of the meat.<br/> <br/>This place also offered free gum, grasshopper samples, and had their homemade aguas frescas which was a refreshing combination of tamarind, chili, and mango. Overall, this was a great place for brunch, with the only knock being that it was too small of a place and had roughly 4 seats overall."

The Tuna Yuk Hue was a light and refreshing appetizer with cucumber kimchi, roasted marcona almonds, toasted seaweed, and sesame soy sauce drizzled all over the bits of fatty tuna. <br/> <br/> The So Ramen was clearly the star of the show, with the raw veal cooking in the broth and adding an extra dimension to the garlicky broth. It was probably the richest ramen broth I've ever had, yet the flavors weren't overpowering at all. The Gochu Ramen was basically what you would expect ramen to taste like with a gochujang broth, and the pork belly was crispy yet tender on the inside." }
